Create student registration page with name, enrolment no, address and so on. If student wants
to become member of site he has to create his own registration by filling required data on form. Once
student registered , he can use his login id and password for logging in site. After entering User id and
password it will verify with the database of user data. If it is correct then it will link to welcome page
if it is not correct then it will display appropriate message. When user clicks on new user button then
it will link to registration page. Create proper database. Provide proper validations at server side using
PHP filter.
